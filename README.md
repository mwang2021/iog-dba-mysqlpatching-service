IOG Architecture Triage Service
===================================

Overview
This service is the initial estimation of the design, cost, and resource requirements of new projects entering the Infrastructure and Operations group.

Process
When a new project is being entered via IPM process, it gets routed via Jira to the IOG architecture group based on pre-defined business unit assignments. The architect studies the request and if necessary reaches out to the requesting party for more information, potentially gathers details from internal IOG engineering teams, and does a brief "t-shirt sizing" of the request.
